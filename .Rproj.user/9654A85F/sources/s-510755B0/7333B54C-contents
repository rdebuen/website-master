This study aims to explore the factors that lead to local level investment in cycling infrastructure in Mexican Metropolitan areas and to uncover the local level processes that lead to increased attention from policymakers, as well as the barriers that impede implementation.

The interest in this topic stems from the widespread increase in attention to cycling for transportation as an area of policy in Mexico. Over the last decade, cycling has gained prominence in many cities across the country. 

During this time period, there has also been an upward trend in the uptake of policies and programs to promote cycling at both the national and subnational level. These laws recognize and prioritize cycling as a mode of transportation, establish rules for cyclists and motorized vehicles to share roadways, create incentives for cycling and create an initial framework for municipalities to prioritize and undertake the development of cycling infrastructure.

Through qualitative interviews in a multiple case study research design, I study whether and how the adoption of state-level laws, the presence and activity of local NGOs, the technical and financial institutional capacity of local government agencies matter in the use of federal government funds for cycling infrastructure in metropolitan areas. 

This study contributes to research that explains the variation of investment that local governments make to infrastructure that enhances environmental sustainability. This study also brings attention to the both the level and type of cycling initiatives taken in Mexican cities that have not been previously studied. While this study is focused on Mexican Metropolitan areas, it also contributes to understanding the emerging cycling culture that has been observed in many Latin American cities.
