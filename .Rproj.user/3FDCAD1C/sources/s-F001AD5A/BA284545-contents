I am a PhD student in Public Policy and Management from at Evans School of Public Policy and Governance, University of Washington in Seattle. My academic interests center on the relationships between urban transportation, environmental health and human well-being.  My current academic work focuses on understanding (1) the processes surrounding the implementation of cycling infrastructure in Mexican cities (2) How people change their travel behavior on days when driving is restricted due to high levels of air pollution in Mexico City (3) the role of cycling in urban resilience during natural disasters and (4) the use of new app based modes of mobility in Mexico.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a policy analyst for the Latin America Regional Climate Initiative (now Iniciativa Climatica de Mexico)  and the Mario Molina Center. I also worked for the Climate Change and Sustainability department at KPMG Madrid as a Corporate Social Responsibility Analyst.

I hold a Bachelors of Science from the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Mexico, an Msc in Water Science, Policy and Management from Oxford University and an Msc in Public Policy from the University of Washington.
